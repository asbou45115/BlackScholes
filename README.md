### ðŸ“ˆ Black-Scholes Option P&L Heatmap
This is a Streamlit app that visualizes the Profit & Loss (P&L) of call and put options across a range of spot prices and dates using the Black-Scholes model.

ðŸš€ Features
- ðŸ“… Select custom start and expiration dates
- ðŸ’° Set ranges for spot prices, number of contracts, and volatility
- ðŸ§  Choose between P&L in dollars or as a % of maximum risk
- ðŸ§Š Interactive heatmaps for both Call and Put options
- ðŸ§® Displays Black-Scholes formulas and explanations
- ðŸ“š Educational and visual aid for options trading concepts

ðŸ§  How it Works
The app uses the Black-Scholes model to compute option prices over a grid of:
- Spot prices (S)
- Dates until expiration (t)
- It then calculates the P&L relative to the entry price and visualizes the results using Seaborn heatmaps.
- At expiration, the P&L is calculated using the intrinsic value. For earlier dates, the current theoretical option price is used.
